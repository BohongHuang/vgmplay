* Dependencies
- [[https://github.com/BohongHuang/cl-agbplay][cl-agbplay]]
- [[https://github.com/bohonghuang/claw-raylib][claw-raylib]] (requires ~libraylib~ installed in your system)
- [[https://github.com/Frechmatz/cl-wave-file-writer][cl-wave-file-writer]]
For those dependencies miss in Quicklisp, you might clone them into ~local-projects~ under your Quicklisp installation folder.
* Usage
1. Download released binary or compile from source using ASDF. On GNU/Linux,
   it's required to have ~libraylib~ and ~libraygui~ installed in your system. So if you want to use the released binary without building anything yourself,
   it's recommended to download the Windows version release and run it on Wine. 
2. Create a directory named "ROM" under where you launch the program and place your ROM into it.
3. Open the ROM in the program, and enjoy the high-quality audio playback for the ROM.
